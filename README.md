# ⚽ FIFA 21 Players Data Analysis
## Project Background 🌍
The FIFA 21 dataset provides detailed information about professional football players from around the world as of the 2020–2021 season. This real-world data includes player names, nationalities, clubs, wages, skill ratings, and physical attributes. By analyzing and cleaning this data, businesses such as sports agencies, clubs, or talent scouts can make more informed decisions regarding player scouting, investment, and marketing strategies.

The dataset spans across over 18,000 players from more than 160 countries and over 700 clubs, offering a deep view into talent distribution, wage trends, and player valuations during the 2020–2021 period.

## Project Deliverables & Actionable Insights 🎯
#### * Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicate entries, corrected data types (e.g., wage/price formats), and normalized attributes for better analysis.
#### * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends in player market values, wages, preferred foot distribution, age groups, and overall ratings.
#### * Trend Discovery:
##### - Noticed a strong concentration of top-rated players between ages 25-29.
##### - Players from Europe dominate the top 5% of wage earners.
#### * Segmented Insights: Segregated players based on club, country, age group, and value tiers for targeted scouting and marketing strategies.

#### Initial Checks Included:
##### - Converted 'Wage' and 'Value' fields from string to numeric (handling '€' and 'M/K' suffixes).
##### - Filled missing values for club and nationality.
##### - Removed inconsistent or duplicate player entries.
## Executive Summary 📑
This project analyzed over 18,000 FIFA 21 players to uncover talent distribution, value trends, and wage disparities. The cleaning and analysis revealed that:

##### * 85% of players earn under €50K weekly, with a tiny fraction (around 2%) earning more than €150K.
##### * Europe dominates player wages and values, accounting for 74% of the top-rated players.
##### * Most players peak in performance between ages 25 and 29.
##### * Clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona consistently attract the highest-valued players.
These findings empower clubs, scouts, and marketing agencies to make informed recruitment and sponsorship decisions based on real-world data.

## Recommendations ✅
#### * Target 25-29 Age Group: Focus scouting efforts on players aged 25–29 to maximize value for money.
#### * Leverage European Markets: Prioritize scouting in European clubs for high-skill, high-value players.
#### * Negotiate Young Talent: Identify players with high potential ratings under 22 years old for long-term investment.
#### * Brand Collaborations: Partner marketing efforts with highly-rated players for maximum audience reach, focusing especially on players with high international reputations.
